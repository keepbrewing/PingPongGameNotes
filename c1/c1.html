					<section>Day 1</section>
					<section> This class helped us think about programming in an object-oriented manner. We designed Paddle and Ball class and created objects using the class to use it in our program.</section>
					<section> We learnt some very important concepts in programming. We learnt a style of programming which advanced programmers use for writing code. </section>
				</section>
				<section>
					<section>This is the code from the previous class:
						<pre>
							<code data-trim data-noescape class="hljs javascript has-highlights">
								function draw(){
									background("white");
									rect(390, World.mouseY, 10, 70);
									rect(0, 150, 10, 70);
									rect(200, 200, 10, 70);
								}
							</code>
						</pre>
				</section>
				<section>
					These instructions to the computer draw what we want on the screen - but do the instructions themselves tell what they are doing? The code tells it is drawing a rectangle but it does not tell it is meant for a paddle or the ball. Someone looking at the code might not know what the code is doing.
				</section>
				<section>
					Our program, as it is now, is very hard to read. A good program should tell the reader what it is doing. One way to make our program more reader friendly is by adding comments. We add comments by using “//” (two backslashes). By commenting on the code, we can tell the readers of our program, what our code is trying to do. Computer ignores these lines.
				</section>
				<section>After adding comments:
						<pre>
							<code data-trim data-noescape class="hljs javascript has-highlights">
								function draw(){
									//clears the screen
									background("white");

									//draws the player paddle
									rect(390, World.mouseY, 10, 70);
									
									//draws the computer paddle
									rect(0, 150, 10, 70);

									//draws the ball
									rect(200, 200, 10, 70);
								}
							</code>
						</pre>
				</section>
				<section>
					Do you think this makes the code more readable? Do you think others can understand what you are trying to do in this program?
				</section>
			</section>
			<section>
				<section>
					Programmers always add comments to help other programmers understand their code. Comments added to our program make our program easy to understand. But our program itself doesn’t tell us about what it is doing. A good program should explain itself what it is doing - even without the comments. In fact, a good program should read like a story. You should be able to read any part of the code and know what’s happening in the program.
				</section>
				<section>
					We are actually going to learn this style of writing programs. This kind of easy to read programs are really useful when many programmers are working together on a single project - maybe a big game or application. Because these programs are easily readable, it helps us build complex logic in our code easily. 
				</section>
				<section>
					In this programming style, we write code as if everything in the programming world were an object - just like in real world. In real world, everything around us is an object. Each object has some properties and functions. PROPERTIES are the qualities/characteristics of the object. FUNCTIONS are something which the object can do.
				</section>
				<section>
					For example, a smartphone has properties like color, height, thickness etc. and functions like calling, browsing etc.
				</section>
			</section>
			<section>
				<section>
					Our game has three objects: two paddles and a ball. Let us learn how to create these objects in the program.
				</section>
				<section>
					How are objects created in a factory? First,  there is a mould/blueprint - which has the design of the object. The new objects are made with this design in mind.
				</section>
				<section>
					Programmers use the exact same technique while creating objects in their program. A programmer creating a paddle object would first make the design- and assign all the properties and functions of the object to it. Based on this design , the programmer will create as many paddle objects as they want in the game. The design is called a CLASS in programming. This way of looking at the programming world as objects is called object-oriented programming.
				</section>
			</section>
			<section>
				<section>
				First create a class. This is how we do it:
					<pre>
							<code data-trim data-noescape class="hljs javascript has-highlights" data-line-numbers="1-3">
								function Paddle(){

								}

								function draw(){
									//clears the screen
									background("white");

									//draws the player paddle
									rect(390, World.mouseY, 10, 70);
									
									//draws the computer paddle
									rect(0, 150, 10, 70);

									//draws the ball
									rect(200, 200, 10, 70);
								}
							</code>
						</pre>
					</section>
					<section>
						Inside the Paddle class or Paddle design, we should define all the properties and functions for the paddle:
						<pre>
							<code data-trim data-noescape class="hljs javascript has-highlights" data-line-numbers="2-5">
								function Paddle(){
									this.width = 10;
									this.height = 70;
									this.xPosition = 0;
									this.yPosition = 0;
								}

								function draw(){
									//clears the screen
									background("white");

									//draws the player paddle
									rect(390, World.mouseY, 10, 70);
									
									//draws the computer paddle
									rect(0, 150, 10, 70);

									//draws the ball
									rect(200, 200, 10, 70);
								}
							</code>
						</pre>
						The xPosition and yPosition can be changed later.
					</section>
					<section>
						For object creation, we created an object and stored it in a variable named playerPaddle:
						<pre>
							<code data-trim data-noescape class="hljs javascript has-highlights" data-line-numbers="13">
								function Paddle(){
									this.width = 10;
									this.height = 70;
									this.xPosition = 0;
									this.yPosition = 0;
								}

								function draw(){
									//clears the screen
									background("white");

									//draws the player paddle
									var playerPaddle = new Paddle();
									
									//draws the computer paddle
									rect(0, 150, 10, 70);

									//draws the ball
									rect(200, 200, 10, 70);
								}
							</code>
						</pre>
					</section>
					<section>"this" refers to the object we will create.</section>
					<section>
						We can change properties like this:
						<pre>
							<code data-trim data-noescape class="hljs javascript has-highlights" data-line-numbers="14,15">
								function Paddle(){
									this.width = 10;
									this.height = 70;
									this.xPosition = 0;
									this.yPosition = 0;
								}

								function draw(){
									//clears the screen
									background("white");

									//draws the player paddle
									var playerPaddle = new Paddle();
									playerPaddle.xPosition = 390;
									playerPaddle.yPosition = World.mouseY;
									
									//draws the computer paddle
									rect(0, 150, 10, 70);

									//draws the ball
									rect(200, 200, 10, 70);
								}
							</code>
						</pre>
					</section>
					<section>
						We still need to display it on screen. Though our PlayerPaddle object with all properties is created, it does not know how to do anything. It does not even know how to display itself. We need to define in our Paddle class/design on how the paddle should display itself. Let us do that:
						<pre>
							<code data-trim data-noescape class="hljs javascript has-highlights" data-line-numbers="7-9">
								function Paddle(){
									this.width = 10;
									this.height = 70;
									this.xPosition = 0;
									this.yPosition = 0;

									this.display = function(){
										rect(this.xPosition, this.yPosition, this.width, this.height);
									};
								}

								function draw(){
									//clears the screen
									background("white");

									//draws the player paddle
									var playerPaddle = new Paddle();
									playerPaddle.xPosition = 390;
									playerPaddle.yPosition = World.mouseY;
									
									//draws the computer paddle
									rect(0, 150, 10, 70);

									//draws the ball
									rect(200, 200, 10, 70);
								}
							</code>
						</pre>
					</section>
					<section>
						Let us tell the PlayerPaddle to display itself now:
						<pre>
							<code data-trim data-noescape class="hljs javascript has-highlights" data-line-numbers="20">
								function Paddle(){
									this.width = 10;
									this.height = 70;
									this.xPosition = 0;
									this.yPosition = 0;

									this.display = function(){
										rect(this.xPosition, this.yPosition, this.width, this.height);
									};
								}

								function draw(){
									//clears the screen
									background("white");

									//draws the player paddle
									var playerPaddle = new Paddle();
									playerPaddle.xPosition = 390;
									playerPaddle.yPosition = World.mouseY;
									playerPaddle.display();
									
									//draws the computer paddle
									rect(0, 150, 10, 70);

									//draws the ball
									rect(200, 200, 10, 70);
								}
							</code>
						</pre>
					</section>
			</section>
			<section>
				<section>
				This is how we create objects. First, we create a class, then we assign properties and functions to that class and then we create objects of that class, store it in variables, modify properties if needed and call their functions.
			</section>
			<section>
				Tasks after this class:
				<ul>
					<li>Create object for the computer paddle.</li>
					<li>Create the Ball class and create ball object.</li>
				</ul>
